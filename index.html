        <p id="cover-letter" style="text-indent : 3em;">
          Hey there! I am currently an undergraduate student studying
          Information Technology & Informatics with concentrations in Data
          Management, Analytics, and Information Visualization & Web Design and
          Development. I am looking to gain expertise in the development
          industry with the realms of web development and UI/ UX design. I also
          have interests in data science, design- thinking, and data management.
          My work experience shows competency in leadership, teamwork, and data
          research. My current technical skills show proficiency in coding
          languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript, as well as HTML5 and
          CSS3. My building skill set and work experience have made me capable
          of working with teams, driving progress toward project completion, and
          providing quality assurance and on-time delivery.
